# Global Energy Scenario Modeling Dataset
  The dataset serves as a vital resource for analyzing the influence of capital costs on energy investments across various scenarios and regions. It encompasses data from three prominent models: Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment, Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment, and World Induced Technical Change Hybrid Model, along with key metrics such as maximum and minimum weighted average cost of capital (WACC). By tracking these variables over time, researchers can uncover patterns that highlight how capital costs affect investment decisions in renewable energy.

  This analysis is crucial for understanding the financial barriers or incentives that influence sustainable energy transitions. By employing machine learning techniques, researchers can develop models that predict how fluctuations in economic conditions or policy changes impact WACC, thereby guiding investment strategies. Ultimately, this research can provide actionable insights for policymakers and investors, facilitating informed decisions that promote sustainable development and optimize energy resource allocation in the face of evolving economic landscapes.
